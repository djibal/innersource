## Managing Projects 

Repositories aren't just a place to download code or write scripts â€“ they're also a place to collaborate and work with others in different ways. It depends on you and how you choose to manage your projects, keep it up to date with your repository and this process should be as transparent and integrated as possible. 

[Surveys show](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-3-most-effective-ways-to-build-trust-as-a-leader/) this trust is built not only by doing good, but by communicating good intentions behind these actions.

Being transparent is not a passive state, but an active effort to communicate your decisions and why you're making them. This relates to GitHub because it's where the work happens. How are issues triaged? Where should discussions happen? How are features implemented? These questions are important for you to answer for yourselves, and it's important to communicate the answers to everyone who will interact with your repository.
