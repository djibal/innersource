The workflow features are very important[![CI](https://github.com/djibal/innersource/actions/workflows/blank.yml/badge.svg) Status Badge](https://github.com/djibal/innersource/actions/workflows/blank.yml/)

There's no one perfect workflow or branching strategy that fits every project. However,
when you're collaborating in a repository on GitHub, it's important to have a clear workflow outlined and communicated.
That way, contributors know what to expect and how to get things done
