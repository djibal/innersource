### Workflows & Branching Strategies 
<p> There's no one perfect workflow or branching strategy that fits every project. However,
    
    when you're collaborating in a repository on GitHub, it's important to have a clear workflow outlined and communicated.
    That way, contributors know what to expect and how to get things done.</p>
